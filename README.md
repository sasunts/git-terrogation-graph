* Interrogate the GitHub API to build visualisation of data available tht elucidates some aspect of the softare engineering process, such as a social graph of developers and projects, or a visualisation of indiviudal of team performance. Provide a visualisation of this using the d3js library


### Complete:
* `interrogation.py` is made to complete the first part of the task. This allows me to
login with my GitHub account and will print on the console with a few details such as
all my repos, my username and the topics of my Lowest common ancestor repo. I will improve
this by creating a menu with switch cases of all of my repos and the user can chose which
repo to print topics about.
